# Clipper-Tools
A pure Python module containing tools for crystallography and single-particle cryo-EM.

## em 
Contains functions for cutting density out of cryo-EM maps and calculating structure factors

## io
Contains functions for reading and writing maps, map coefficients, model coordinates, and structure factors

## utils
A number of useful functions, including:
* Needleman-Wunsch algorithm for pairwise sequence alignment
* B-factor analysis
* Ramachandran validation
* Amino acid atomic geometry validation
* Mainchain and sidechain torsion angle calculators

## xray
Contains functions that make it easy to do molecular replacement with cryo-EM maps
